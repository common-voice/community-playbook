## 📝 Text corpus

### Our purpose

Collect or generate text corpus under public domain licence that can be read by people to facilitate their voice donations. Public domain texts are creative works that have no exclusive intellectual property rights. 

### Who we are

We are a community of text collectors and creators, always looking for places with text corpora we can extract and process so it can be transformed into short and simple sentences for people to read.

### What’s success

Generate as many sentences as possible in our languages. Having more sentences allows contributors to donate more hours of voice data.

* 5,000 sentences 	_allow_ 	5,5 hrs of voice
* 9,000 sentences 	_allow_ 	10 hrs of voice
* 90,000 sentences	_allow_ 	100 hrs of voice
* 1,800,000 sentences _allow_ 	2000 hrs of voice

⚠️ _You will need at least 5000 validated sentences to have your language enabled for voice contributions on our voice collection site._

### What we do

#### **Sentence extraction**

We have developed [a tool to extract sentences](https://github.com/Common-Voice/cv-sentence-extractor) from large sources of public domain text, with a focus easy-to-read corpus and Wikipedia.

This is the easiest and fastest way to get more than a million sentences as soon as possible for your language.

ℹ️ <em>Please read <a href="https://github.com/Common-Voice/cv-sentence-extractor#common-voice-sentence-extractor">the tool documentation</a> on how to generate specific rules for your language. </em></p>

⚠️ _Important: Due to legal reasons Mozilla needs to be the one running the final extraction, so please don’t do any manual processing to the resulting extraction during your tests. We can apply manual clean-up after the final version is generated by Mozilla._

🔨 _Skills required to help: Command line usage and git, familiar with regular expressions._

#### **Sentence collection**

We have also created a [sentence collection tool](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/sentence-collector/#/) that allows contributors to collect and validate sentences created by the community. You can use this tool also to import and clean-up small-to-medium-sized public domain corpus you have found or collected.

ℹ️ _Please read [the collector how-to](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/sentence-collector/#/how-to) before using this tool and check the [community guidelines on how to validate sentences](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/discussion-of-new-guidelines-for-uploaded-sentence-validation/37718)_.

🔨 _Skills required to help: Strong grammar knowledge of the target language you are contributing to._

#### **Large corpus validation**

If you have found an existing public domain corpus bigger than 100K sentences, we have an independent process to handle it, since we understand that manual validation using the sentence collector is not ideal.

ℹ️ _Please create a new topic on [our ](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice/)discourse, so we can evaluate if your corpus fits the licence and size requirements to run this process._

🔨 _Skills required to help: Expertise processing and cleaning up text, linguistics/language expertise to check the quality of the resulting sentences._

#### **Tooling development**

Contributors also develop, maintain and update the sentence extractor and collector code.

* Sentence Extractor: 🐞 [Open issues](https://github.com/Common-Voice/cv-sentence-extractor/projects/1?fullscreen=true) - 🔨 _Skills needed: Rust_
* Sentence Collector: 🐞 [Open issues](https://github.com/Common-Voice/sentence-collector/projects/2?fullscreen=true) - 🔨 _Skills needed: React, JavaScript, Node.js_

#### Collaborating with publishers of copyrighted works

We build relationships with organisations or individuals who would be happy to donate their text under a Public domain license. 

⚠️ _Important: Due to legal reasons Mozilla you will have to confirm the agreement with the copyright owner. This process is outlined on [cc0waiver_process page](sub_pages/cc0waiver_process.md).
