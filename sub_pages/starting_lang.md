# Speech recognition should work for all languages across the world.

The Common Voice team is here to support you to have your language added to the platform. If you are starting a new language, here is the information you need !

### The steps are;

1. Language Request: Someone asks for a language to be added 
2. Website Localization: Atleast 70% website text is translated into your language 
3. Sentence Collection: Sentences are collected for people to read aloud based on your language band
4. New Language Launch: We launch the Common Voice site in this language
5. Voice Contribution: People come and contribute short speech clips
6. Voice Validation: Other people validate those voice clips.
7. Dataset Release: We release the dataset every 3 months.

### Request the language 

Once you have sumbitted a request via the website or github we will ask for the following details to get you started.

- Language name
- Language code (ISO-639-1 code)
- Language Speaker Population
- Plural forms
- Script 

### Localise the website

Once we have received this information, we will start to enable your language on Pontoon. Pontoon supports the localisation element of the Common Voice Platform. 
Learn more about [Pontoon](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/about?tab=how-localize#playbook) on the Common Voice Website. You will need to create a Pontoon account, so we can set you up as team manager. 
Please share with us the email address you have used to start creating your Pontoon account to commonvoice@mozilla.com. 

### Gather sentences

The second step is building a text corpus, this is a crucial step as sentences are read out by contributors to make the dataset. 
As you may be aware, not all languages are equally represented online. 
We want to ensure languages are equitably included in Common Voice so we have introduced sentence bands. 
Sentence bands are categories in which a language needs a number of sentences relative to the language needs. 
Please share with us which band you think is best for your language. 

- Band A: Starting at 750 Sentences, the language has a speaker population less than 1 million, resource self-assessment is low and language vitality is low.
- Band B: Starting at 2000 Sentences, the language has a speaker population less than 10 million, resource self-assessment is medium and language vitality is moderate.
- Band C: Starting at 5000 Sentences, the language has a speaker population over than 10 million, resource self-assessment is high and language vitality is high.

You can submit sentences for your language via sentence collector. sentence extractor and bulk submission.

### Mobilise your community to contribute their data

The third step is creating community. Contributing in diverse communities helps to support the representation of voices in the dataset. 
Contributing to the community is also fun! We have created a [community-building template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Kyf3g47HjUCJ55c3aLpvxf96R2cUti2mcRyiyXej90/edit?usp=sharing) to help you think about the goals, resources, objectives and literature to inspire you.

If you have any questions or would like a zoom call to discuss the project please feel free to ask, we are more than happy to support you! Reach out to us via commonvoice@mozilla.com 

All the best,
