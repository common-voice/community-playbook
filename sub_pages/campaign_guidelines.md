# Campaign Guidelines: Supporting Community Mobilisation Experience on the Common Voice Platform


#### Are you thinking of running an event or campaign ?

<p> 


Firstly check out our [community drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YsLzbzttpJ9VuyJSqwtfx9lFi4gwj6Lf?usp=sharing) with planning templates and tips, also please reach out to a [Mozilla Resource rep](https://community.mozilla.org/en/groups/mozilla-reps-resources/) for resource support.
  
We want to ensure that the Common Voice Platform performs well for when communities run events and campaigns. This guidance is created to support communication between the community mobilisations and the product team.
 

<p/>

## All Community events

<p> All Community activities that include campaigns and events need to be visible on the Community Portal.
This helps us to understand the required Common Voice platform experiences of community events that engage with the Common Voice Platform.
Please include on your event page the expected number of attendees or target audience you would like to reach.

You can watch this tutorial to learn how to add events to the [community portal](https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5fedd4f1-1169-4f6f-8ff6-ae460101a52e)

## How can we diversify ways in participating in Common Voice outside of the Common Voice Platform ?

<p>Consider creating campaigns or events that have calls to actions that enable the healthy development of voice contributions such as:

### Language Resources: Text Corpus

* Hosting write-athons that support the language resources for language communities. The language resources could help build text corpus’
* Evaluating content of text corpus’ are there missing variants, technical terms, phonetic gender inclusive languages and terms ?


### Localised Resources

* Consider encouraging different groups of people to contribute within your community e.g hosting science comm events on gender inclusion.
* Localising the Common Voice platform via pontoon and community communications via discourse. <p/>
