# üåç Localization

## Why is Localisation Important?
Adapting and translating the project tools and materials helps people to understand and engage with the project. We use [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/common-voice/) to localise website strings

‚ÑπÔ∏è _Please read [how to use pontoon](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/tools/pontoon/) before starting to use the tool, you might need to ask the Mozilla localization team for permissions to validate suggestions_.

- How people can reuse the resource could you share them on your community sub discourse ?
