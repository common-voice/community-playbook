## Language Communities of Common Voice

There are currently 140 [languages](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/languages) contributing either text, voice clips and localizations on Common Voice. Some langauges have formal communities that support and collabrate with each other. 

#### Why build a local community ?

Open source projects thrive with communities that nurture people, who create collaboratively and hold each other accountable towards a common goal. 

Starting and growing a language on Common Voice requires collaborating with a diversity of people, who are inspired by a common goal. Community building helps to; build a foundational understanding of how people want to contribute to your language, it can provide space to share or produce knowledge and skills, discuss and organise towards goals. 

Check out our [community building template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Kyf3g47HjUCJ55c3aLpvxf96R2cUti2mcRyiyXej90/edit?usp=sharing) on our communal drive.  
## Community Platforms 

The main channels that connect all of the language communication are [Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice) for topic discussions (e.g announcements, topical discussions) and [matrix](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#common-voice:mozilla.org) for community chats. To request a new language category for Common Voice Discourse please message heyhillary on discourse. 

For Common Voice site issues, please share these on out [github](https://github.com/mozilla/common-voice). Some language communities have created their own channels. We maintain the list of languages community channels on the [Common Voice Github](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md)

### Using the Common Voice Trademark 

“Mozilla” and “Common Voice” are trademarks of the Mozilla Foundation and are subject to Mozilla’s trademark policy. But you can of course use these terms to describe and refer to Common Voice when organizing community activities. The project needs community involvement to grow and succeed!

So you should feel free to spread the word about Common Voice. Just be careful not to use Mozilla trademarks in a way that would give the impression that Mozilla itself is organizing an independent community event or resource. For example, the name of your community website or event should prominently include your own group name. The Esperanto and Dhivehi community sites are great examples. They refer to Common Voice but have their own identity. 

Mozilla is happy to answer any questions you have about using Mozilla trademarks, you can email the team at trademark-permissions@mozilla.com, and cc commvoice@mozilla.com
