# Community Page

Common Voice has a variety of communities that support the project in different important areas, they are usually grouped by language.

## Participation Guidelines

Common Voice communities are governed by Mozilla's code of conduct and etiquette guidelines, we take this very seriously and no violations are tolerated. 

We encourage you to please read [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/) before contributing to this project. For more information on how to report violations of the Community Participation Guidelines, please read our ['How to Report'](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/reporting/) page.

## Community Platforms 

The main channels that connect all of the language communication are [Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice) for topic discussions (e.g announcements, topical discussions) and [matrix](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#common-voice:mozilla.org) for community chats.

### Using the Common Voice Trademark 

“Mozilla” and “Common Voice” are trademarks of the Mozilla Foundation and are subject to Mozilla’s trademark policy. But you can of course use these terms to describe and refer to Common Voice when organizing community activities. The project needs community involvement to grow and succeed!

So you should feel free to spread the word about Common Voice. Just be careful not to use Mozilla trademarks in a way that would give the impression that Mozilla itself is organizing an independent community event or resource. For example, the name of your community website or event should prominently include your own group name. The Esperanto and Dhivehi community sites are great examples. They refer to Common Voice but have their own identity. 

Mozilla is happy to answer any questions you have about using Mozilla trademarks, you can email the team at trademark-permissions@mozilla.com, and cc commvoice@mozilla.com
