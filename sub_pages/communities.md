# Contribute with Community 

Building Voice Dataset requires collaboration, trust and most important understanding of language community issues.

As your language participates in Common Voice we encourage you to take part in community building, you can bring interpersonal or/and technical skills to support the growth of your language on Common Voice. For example:

* Start and take part in discussions on [Community Social Platforms](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md)
* Host events with [Mozilla Resource Rep Funding](https://community.mozilla.org/en/groups/mozilla-reps-resources/)
* Contribute Open Source Code
* Create with other contributors a [Langauge Specific Community Building Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Kyf3g47HjUCJ55c3aLpvxf96R2cUti2mcRyiyXej90/edit?usp=sharing)

Common Voice contributors are expected to uphold you to abide by [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (CPG)](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/). Everyone should feel comfortable and supported, if at any point you experience violations of the CPG [please report](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/reporting/) and we will invesigate and support you.

####  Using the Common Voice Trademark 

“Mozilla” and “Common Voice” are trademarks of the Mozilla Foundation and are subject to Mozilla’s trademark policy. But you can of course use these terms to describe and refer to Common Voice when organizing community activities. The project needs community involvement to grow and succeed!

So you should feel free to spread the word about Common Voice. Just be careful not to use Mozilla trademarks in a way that would give the impression that Mozilla itself is organizing an independent community event or resource. For example, the name of your community website or event should prominently include your own group name. The Esperanto and Dhivehi community sites are great examples. They refer to Common Voice but have their own identity. 

Mozilla is happy to answer any questions you have about using Mozilla trademarks, you can email the team at trademark-permissions@mozilla.com, and cc commvoice@mozilla.com
