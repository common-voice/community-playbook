# üìù Text Corpus

## Our purpose

Collect or generate text corpus under public domain licence that can be read by people to facilitate their voice donations.

### Who we are

We are a community of text collectors and creators, always looking for places with text corpora we can extract and process so it can be transformed into short and simple sentences for people to read.

### What‚Äôs success

Generate as many sentences as possible in our languages. Having more sentences allows contributors to donate more hours of voice data.

* 5,000 sentences     _allow_     5,5 hrs of voice
* 9,000 sentences     _allow_     10 hrs of voice
* 90,000 sentences    _allow_     100 hrs of voice
* 1,800,000 sentences _allow_     2000 hrs of voice

‚ö†Ô∏è _You will need at least 5000 validated sentences to have your language enabled for voice contributions on our voice collection site._

### What we do

#### Sentence extraction

We have developed [a tool to extract sentences](https://github.com/Common-Voice/cv-sentence-extractor) from large sources of public domain text, with a focus easy-to-read corpus and Wikipedia.

This is the easiest and fastest way to get more than a million sentences as soon as possible for your language.

 ‚ÑπÔ∏è _Please read [the tool documentation](https://github.com/Common-Voice/cv-sentence-extractor#common-voice-sentence-extractor) on how to generate specific rules for your language._

‚ö†Ô∏è _Important: Due to legal reasons Mozilla needs to be the one running the final extraction, so please don‚Äôt do any manual processing to the resulting extraction during your tests. We can apply manual clean-up after the final version is generated by Mozilla._

üî® _Skills required to help: Command line usage and git, familiar with regular expressions._

#### Sentence collection

We have also created a [sentence collection tool](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/write) that allows contributors to collect and validate sentences created by the community.

‚ÑπÔ∏è _Please check the [community guidelines on how to validate sentences](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/discussion-of-new-guidelines-for-uploaded-sentence-validation/37718)._

üî® _Skills required to help: Strong grammar knowledge of the target language you are contributing to._

#### Large corpus validation

If you have found an existing public domain corpus bigger than 100K sentences, we have an independent process to handle it, since we understand that manual validation using the sentence collector is not ideal. You can use the [bulk upload submission](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/write).

‚ÑπÔ∏è _Please create a new topic on [our](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice/) Discourse, so we can evaluate if your corpus fits the licence and size requirements to run this process._

üî® _Skills required to help: Expertise processing and cleaning up text, linguistics/language expertise to check the quality of the resulting sentences._

#### Tooling development

Contributors also develop, maintain and update the sentence extractor.
